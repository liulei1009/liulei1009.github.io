Lei submitted a [regular paper](../assets/TGRS-submmison-ML-TEC.pdf) to *IEEE TGRS*. The paper This paper applies the convolutional long short-term memory (convLSTM)-based machine learning (ML) models to forecast global ionospheric total electron content (TEC) maps with up to 24 hours of lead time at a 1-hour interval.
