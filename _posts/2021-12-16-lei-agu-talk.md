Lei Liu will be presenting a talk at 2021 AGU Fall meeting titled Machine learning-based Prediction of global TEC and High-latitude ROTI Maps. In this presentation, the convLSTM-based ML model is to tackle two different GNSS applications: prediction of global TEC maps and high-latitude ROTI maps.
The ML model we developed could play an important role in warning for space weather and satellite navigation communities.

Lab grad student Daoxin Li will be presenting a talk at CUNY 2021 titled Acquiring recursive structures through distributional learning. This work asks how distributional learning could help learners figure out which structures allow recursion (and which don't!) in their language.
