Lei Liu will be presenting a talk at 2021 AGU Fall meeting titled Machine learning-based Prediction of global TEC and High-latitude ROTI Maps. This work asks how distributional learning could help learners figure out which structures allow recursion (and which don't!) in their language.

In this presentation, the convLSTM-based ML model is to tackle two different GNSS applications: prediction of global TEC maps and high-latitude ROTI maps.
The ML model we developed could play an important role in warning for space weather and satellite navigation communities.
