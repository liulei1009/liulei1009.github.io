Sharing knowledge is important to us, so we've linked some resources to help you learn how we do things in our lab. Feel free to borrow or adapt anything you like. 

### JupyterLab

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is kind of like RStudio. Here is a [JupyterLab demo](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/master?urlpath=lab/tree/demo) and below is some more information about our lab's workflow in case you'd like to borrow it: 

- [How to analyze data with the jupyter/datascience-notebook](2021-01-09-datascience-container)
- [How to customize the jupyter/datascience-notebook container](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXxUcZDSNwA&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=KathrynSchuler)

### InGeO

The Integrated Geoscience Observatory [(InGeO)](https://ingeo.datatransport.org/home/) is a project supported by the National Science Foundation[(NSF)](https://nsf.gov/). The pilot project was developed under NSF [EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org/) grant #1541057 to [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/). EarthCube aims to improve collaboration between geoscientists, access to scientific data, and reproducibility of scientific results.

### GNSS-IR

### Machine Learning

### Data Access (TO DO)
- Spire Global: [Spire](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/csdap/commercial-datasets) space weather measurements, such as TEC, ionosphere profiles, and scintillations.
- CYGNSS
- Ground-based GNSS Network

<!-- ### Websites and Wikis

Our website is hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses the [constrast](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast) theme.  We also keep a [Lab Wiki](https://wiki.childlanglab.com/) including our [Lab Handbook](https://wiki.childlanglab.com/resources/lab-handbook), to keep track of how we do things and share with others. Feel free to use ours as a jumping off point to create your own. -->
