  <p align="center">We are a research lab at the University of Pennsylvania, studying how children learn languages. We're especially interested in why children seem to be better at language learning than adults are.  We want to find out whether there is something different about the way children learn or the way their brains are organized that makes language learning come naturally to them.</p>
