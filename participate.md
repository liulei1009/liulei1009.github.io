Our work is made possible by research participants like you, who volunteer to take part in our studies. If you have questions about our work or want to [sign up]() to participate, [contact us](mailto:childlanglab@sas.upenn.edu)! We'd love to hear from you.

### Children and families

Children and families can participate at our lab in Philadelphia, PA or online via our virtual lab. Online visits usually involve video chatting with one of our [research assistants](../people) or sending in a video of you and your child doing a particular task (like reading a story together).

### Adults

Penn students can participate (online or in person) by signing up for [SONA](https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/research/participate-research).  If you are not a Penn student, you can sign up to participate in online research via [Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/participants).
