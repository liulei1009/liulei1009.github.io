Our work is made possible by research participants like you, who volunteer to take part in our studies. If you have questions about our work or want to [sign up]() to participate, [contact us](mailto:lei.liu@colorado.edu)! We'd love to hear from you.

### Children and families

Children and families can participate at our lab in Philadelphia, PA or online via our virtual lab. Online visits usually involve video chatting with one of our [research assistants](../people) or sending in a video of you and your child doing a particular task (like reading a story together).
