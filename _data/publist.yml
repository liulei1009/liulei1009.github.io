  description: We investigate multi-scale ionospheric responses to the May 27, 2017, geomagnetic storm over the Asian sector by using multi-instrumental observations, including ground-based global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) network, constellation observing system for meteorology, ionosphere and climate radio occultation, the FengYun-3C (FY-3C) GNSS occultation sounder electron density profiles and in situ plasma density observations provided by both Swarm and defense meteorological satellite program missions.
